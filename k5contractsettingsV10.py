"""Summary: This file is used to store all the details/parameters necessary to successfully
run the build_multi_project_demo.py script.
Add all the details specific to your K5 environment - 
username, password, etc.

CAUTION : You'll need two free projects to use this script. And the accompanying purge script obliterates everything in those projects, ensure you're happy to loose everything.
Be very careful using the purge script - there's no undo button.
